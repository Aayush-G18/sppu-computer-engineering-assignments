    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My journey began with a fascination for uncovering hidden patterns within data. This natural curiosity led me to the world of machine learning, where I found the perfect playground for my mind. Armed with Python and MySQL under my belt, I built my first model analyzing stock market trends, a project that ignited my passion for extracting actionable insights from vast datasets. Today, I thrive on tackling real-world challenges, like predicting customer churn for e-commerce platforms or optimizing search engine algorithms. The dream of leveraging technology to make a tangible difference in the world keeps me fueled and excited for the next problem to solve.</p>
