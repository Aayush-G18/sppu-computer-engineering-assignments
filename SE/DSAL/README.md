ASSIGNMENT LIST:

1. Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree:
  a) Insert new node
  b) Find number of nodes in longest path from root
  c) Minimum data value found in the tree
  d) Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
  e) Search a value

2. Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree, perform the following operations on it:
  a) Perform inorder, preorder and postorder traversal
  b) Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
  c) Find the height of the tree
  d) Copy this tree to another tree (operator =)
  e) Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes
  f) Erase all nodes in a binary tree
(Note: implement both recursive and iterative methods)

3. Create an inordered threaded binary tree. Perform inorder, preorder traversals without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze time and space complexity of algorithm.

4. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers.

5. Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open hashing technique: separate chaining using linked list Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert (key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

6. Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

7. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

8. Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … < kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access probability for each key.

9. A dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of an entry. Provide facility to display whole data in sorted Ascending / Descending order. Also find out how many comparisons are required for finding any entry. Use height balance tree and find complexity for finding a keyword.

10. Implement the Heap Sort algorithm demonstrating the Heap / Shell data structure with modularity of programming language.

11. Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular student. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use Sequential File to maintain the data.

12. Implementation of a direct access file: insertion and deletion of a record from a Direct Access File.
